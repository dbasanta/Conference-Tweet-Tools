# Conference-Tweet-Tools
Tools for gathering and analyzing tweets from conferences and chat-ups. This includes searching for tweets with a given hashtag, summarizing them as a CSV (comma separated value) file, saving them as a JSON and/or Python pickle file, and analyzing them for word-frequency or individual contributions. Note that a Twitter search using the Twitter API will only go back one week, motivating a quick and easy way to collect, concatenate, and sort such tweets as a means of curation.
